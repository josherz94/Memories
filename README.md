## General info
This project was made for the purpose of improving my programming skills as well as learning Android Studio.
It is not published in the Google Play Store, nor will it be in the future.
It is a simple app that allows users to upload "Memories" with a title, description as well as a picture. 
These memories are saved and can be scrolled through. This was accomplished using Android Studios recyclerview
to create a dynamic list of Memory objects. The application also allows users to edit these Memories and view the 
location they were added via Google Maps.
